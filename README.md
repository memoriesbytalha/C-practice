# My .NET Learning Journey

Welcome to my .NET learning repository! This project serves as a collection of notes, practice code, and exercises that I have been working on to learn **.NET** and **C#**. It's a work in progress, and I am constantly adding new content as I grow my knowledge in software development.

## Introduction

I’ve recently started diving into **.NET** and **C#**, two powerful tools in the world of software development. My goal is to learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming, explore various features of C#, and eventually build my own projects. This repository contains all my practice, code samples, and insights from the journey.

## What I've Learned

Here’s a quick summary of the key concepts I’ve learned so far:

### 1. **Basic Syntax & Structure**
   - Understanding the basic structure of a C# program.
   - Working with classes, methods, and variables.
   - Utilizing different data types like `int`, `string`, `double`, etc.

### 2. **Control Flow & Logic**
   - Using `if`, `else`, `switch`, and conditional operators.
   - Mastering loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
   - Understanding ternary operators (`? :`) for conditional assignments.

### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Creating classes and objects.
   - Working with access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) to control visibility.
   - Using constructors to initialize objects.
   - Inheritance: understanding how to derive a class from another and reuse code.

### 4. **Arrays & Collections**
   - Declaring and initializing arrays.
   - Using `foreach` loops to iterate through arrays.
   - Sorting and performing operations like `Max()`, `Min()`, and `Sum()` on arrays.

### 5. **String Manipulation**
   - Using string methods like `Substring()`, `ToLower()`, and `Replace()`.
   - String formatting with `Console.WriteLine()` and string interpolation (`$""`).

### 6. **Error Handling & Debugging**
   - Basic error handling techniques like `try`, `catch`, and `finally`.
   - Debugging tips to troubleshoot code effectively.

### 7. **Miscellaneous Concepts**
   - Working with constants (`const`), variables, and type casting.
   - The use of `var` for implicit type declaration.
   - Understanding basic data structures and performing operations like array sorting.

## Code Examples

Here are some examples of what I've worked on so far:

### Example 1: Class and Method Example

```csharp
class Car
{
    protected string model = "Mustang";

    public void DisplayModel()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Car model: " + model);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.DisplayModel();
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Loops and Conditional Statements

```csharp
int time = 20;
string result = (time < 24) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

### Example 3: Arrays and Sorting

```csharp
int[] numbers = { 5, 1, 8, 9 };
Array.Sort(numbers);
Console.WriteLine(string.Join(", ", numbers));  // Output: 1, 5, 8, 9
```

## Future Goals

Here are some of my future learning goals:
- Deep dive into **advanced .NET features** (e.g., LINQ, async/await).
- Explore **database integration** and **web development** with ASP.NET.
- Build **real-world applications** to apply what I’ve learned.
- Contribute to open-source .NET projects.

## Conclusion

I am excited to continue learning **.NET** and **C#**, and I hope to build more complex projects in the future. If you have any tips, resources, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out. Let's learn and grow together!
